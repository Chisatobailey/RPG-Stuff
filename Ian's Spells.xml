            <p>You create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration. You see through the eye, which has normal vision plus darkvision to 30 feet. The eye can look in every direction and fullfills the line of sight requirements for spellcasting. As a bonus action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can't enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.</p>

            <p>You extend a stick or rod (whether a magical instrument or just something you grabbed off the ground) and concentrate on one type of thing (water, cats, people, bronze statuary, whatever) and you may learn the direction and location of the nearest example of what you seek. Roll 1d20, on a 10 or higher the spell works, if you roll lower than 10 the spell fails but you regain the spent spell slot. On a critical success you learn the precise location and distance, but on a botch, you lose the spell slot despite the failure.</p>

            <p>With a muttered word, learning information becomes faster and easier. When casting this spell, you may make one ability check to learn information with advantage. You may cast this spell as a full action (rather than a bonus action) to extend the duration to 1 minute.</p>

            <p>With a wave of your hand you temporarily focus all your magical might on defense. Until the start of your next turn, you have advantage on all saving throws and all attacks made against you are made with disadvantage. Additionally, you may move without provoking opportunity attacks.  The affect will end if you cast an offensive spell (one that does damage or requires a saving throw from an enemy) but you may cast other spells as normal.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you reach 11th level the spell lasts for 2 turns rather than 1, and when you reach 17th level the spell becomes an aura that affects all allies within a 30-foot Radius.</p>

            <p>You touch or hold an object and cast your perceptions back along the object’s history. The longer you hold your concentration, the further back in time you will see.

        <description>
            <p>This simple spell allows the caster to increase (or decrease) the flow or movement of air in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on any point within 60 feet that the caster can see. The max speed that can be created (or reduced) by this spell is 5 MPH. The wind can be moved in whatever direction the caster wishes. Outside the spell's sphere the wind dies instantly. </p>
            <p class="indent">As a bonus action on each of the caster's turns, they may move the sphere up to 120 feet. 
            <p class="indent">If cast using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, the max speed change of the wind created by the spell increases by 10 MPH for every slot level above first. Additionally spending a 5th level (or higher) spell slot increases the size of the spell's sphere to a 50-foot-radius and the area becomes difficult terrain. Casting with an 8th level slot will can knock humanoids and small animals prone (Strength save verses caster's spell save DC to withstand this effect) and deal 5 force damage per round to any creature or object it hits. A 9th level slot increases this damage to 10 force and those creatures that are knocked prone are also pushed 10 feet per round. (Save Ends)</p>
