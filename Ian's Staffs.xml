			<p class="indent">Warding Flame: While this staff is on your person, you have advantage on initiative rolls. Each time you hit an enemy with a fire spell cast through this staff you deal an additional 7(2d6) fire damage. The staff can also be used as a magic quarterstaff.</p>
			<p class="indent">Attuned Ownership: This staff, once attuned, will only answer to one person. If anyone, other than the staff's owner, touches Fatemaker it will heat up and deal 4 fire damage.
