            <!-- <p class="flavor">An Arcane warrior who combines magical and martial skills.</p> -->
            <p>An elf nocks an arrow made of spectral blue energy into her bow. She takes careful aim, mutters a short incantation, and lets the arrow fly toward the group of orcs rushing towards her. The arrow slams into the lead orc, then shatters as it explodes into flames and engulfs their ranks.</p>
            <p class="indent">A human mutters words of arcane power under his breath, causing his warhammer to crackle alight with electricity. Turning the corner, he rushes toward a surprised hobgoblin with a cry, and brings the hammer down on its head with a burst of lightning.</p>
            <p class="indent">A guard shoves a captured half-elf ahead of him, leading her deeper into the king's dungeon. She quickly concentrates as the guard turns to regard another inmate, and with a flash buries her newly materialized blade into the man's back.</p>
            <p class="indent">Swordmages are practicioners of both martial combat and arcane magic. To a swordmage, Swordmages are uncivilized brutes whose only answer to conflict is to hit things harder, while wizards are overly delicate and more at home in a library than the battlefield. Swordmages seek to combine the best of both worlds, seamlessly merging their knowledge of the arcane into battle disciplines which no pure knight or mage could hope to achieve.</p>
            <h4>A Mystical Bond</h4>
            <p>The term "swordmage" is in many respects a misnomer; the weapon employed can range from a blade to a hammer to a crossbow. What most defines a swordmage is the unshakable bond that is formed with that particular weapon. Other individuals are able to form similar arcane bonds, but the one between a swordmage and her chosen weapon goes even further.</p>
            <p class="indent">A bonded weapon is like an extension of a swordmage's own body. It is nearly impossible to rob a swordmage of it, and they are able to sense its location no matter how distant, and call it to their hand from any similar range. Some believe that each weapon contains its own minute soul, one equally capable of communicating with the Weave that surrounds everything. By forging this bond, a swordmage's capability to affect the Weave is increased.</p>
            <h4>Magic and Might</h4>
            <p>Without their martial training, a swordmage would still be a formidable (though much less enigmatic) wizard. The meditations and trainings they undertake allow them to comprehend the workings of the Weave, plucking at it to create varied magical effects. Many utilize their spells to augment their own martial ability, while others instead rely on them as their primary methods of combat. Regardless of the specifics, all swordmages channel magic through their weapons, needing no other focus to cast spells.</p>
            <p class="indent">Without their magic, a swordmage would still be a practiced Swordmage. Some spend years practicing combat styles and martial arts, learning to intimately understand the swing of a sword or the drawing of a bow. While many wizards sharpen only their minds, swordmages ensure that their bodies become as powerful a weapon as any spell.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A SWORDMAGE</h4>
            <p>When you create a swordmage character you should consider why you've chosen the complex path of mixing martial combat and magic arts. Were you a squire under the service of a knight who discovered a gift for magic? Were you once a wizard's apprentice, but found yourself drawn to practice with cold steel instead of properly studying?</p>
            <p class="indent">Why have you gone out into the greater world? Do you wish to prove your unorthodox lifestyle as effective as any other? Are you on a personal mission to collect some arcane secret or ancient artifact? Or perhaps you simply want to put your skills to the test.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a Swordmage quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Intelligence. Second, choose the soldier background.</p>
            <h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>
                <p>As a swordmage, you gain the following class features.</p>

            <h5>EQUIPMENT</h5>
            <p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <i>(a)</i> a martial weapon or 
                    <i>(b)</i> a longbow and quiver of 20 arrows
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    <i>(a)</i> a martial weapon or 
                    <i>(b)</i> two simple weapons
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    <i>(b)</i> an explorer's pack
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Swordmage Bond</h4>
            <p>You know a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the end of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand. As long as it is on the same plane as you, you also know its precise location at all times.</p>
            <p class="indent">If your bonded weapon is broken or damaged, you can spend 1 hour of meditation to recreate the weapon from a fragment. This can be done during a short rest. This process automatically destroys any other fragments of the weapon in existence, so you can’t use it to create multiple copies of a broken weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you attempt to bond with a second weapon, you must break the bond with your existing weapon.</p>
            <h4>Magic Sense</h4>
            <p>As an action, you can open yourself to the Weave, allowing you to feel the magical power of objects around you. Until the end of your next turn, you can sense any magic items within 60 feet of you that are not behind total cover. You can sense the presence of a magic item hidden on a person, such as in a pocket or tucked into a boot, so long as the person is not behind total cover. You cannot sense an item contained in an extradimensional space, such as in a bag of holding. You also cannot sense an object protected from divination magic, such as through the spell nondetection, or one affected by a spell such as Nystul's magic aura which hides its magical nature. A thin sheet of lead also blocks your magic sense.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you use this feature, you can select one of the magic items you sense and learn its rarity (common, uncommon, rare, very rare, legendary, or artifact) and its magic item category (whether it is armor, a potion, a ring, a rod, a scroll,a staff, a wand, a weapon, or a wondrous item). Your magic sense has no effect on objects which bear magic but are not magic items.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <h4>Fighting Style</h4>
            <p>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
            <h5>Archery</h5>
            <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
            <h5>Defense</h5>
            <p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
            <h5>Dueling</h5>
            <p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
            <h5>Great Weapon Fighting</h5>
            <p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the twohanded or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>
            <h5>Protection</h5>
            <p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p>
            <h4>Spellcasting</h4>
            <p>Your time spent learning the intricacies of magic allows you to create greater effects beyond the form of your weapon, giving you the ability to cast spells at 2nd level.</p>
            <h5>Spell Slots</h5>
            <p>The Swordmage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <h5>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>
            <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the swordmage spell list (which appears at the end of this document).</p>
            <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Swordmage table shows when you learn more swordmage spells of your choice from this feature. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots on the Swordmage table.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the swordmage spells you know from this feature and replace it with another spell from the swordmage spell list. The new spell must also be of a level for which you have spell slots on the Swordmage table.</p>
            <h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>
            <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your swordmage spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever a swordmage spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a swordmage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <span class="emphasis">Spell save DC</span> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.<br />
                <span class="emphasis">Spell attack modifier</span> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.<br />
            </p>
            <h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>
            <p>You can use your bonded weapon as a spellcasting focus for your swordmage spells.</p>
            <h4>Arcane Infusion</h4>
            <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you gain the ability to infuse your bonded weapon with arcane energy. As a bonus action, while holding your bonded weapon you can expend one spell slot,infusing your weapon for ten minutes. While infused, your weapon deals additional force damage. The extra damage is equal to 1 + the level of the spell slot you expended, to a maximum of 4. If your weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can end this effect on your turn early as a free action. If you are no longer holding or carrying your bonded weapon at the end of your turn, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.</p>
            <h4>Spell Strike</h4>
            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use an action on your turn to attempt a spell strike, concentrating a spell into your weapon and using the strike to cast it onto a target. Choose a spell you know of 1st level or higher with a casting time of one action, and spend a spell slot as if you were casting it as normal. The spell must be capable of targeting a hostile creature or have an area of effect in the shape of a cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere.</p>
            <p class="indent">As part of the action, you then make a single weapon attack with your bonded weapon. If the attack hits, the target suffers the attack's normal effects and the effects of the spell. The target has disadvantage on all saving throws made against the spell (if any), and automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. If the spell has an area of effect, it instead only affects the target. Whether the weapon attack hits or misses, the spell slot is expended and the magic fades from your weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), expending a use when you successfully hit your target. You regain expended uses of this feature when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <h4>Swordmage Discipline</h4>
            <p>At 3rd level, you focus your martial and arcane prowess into a particular discipline, Battlemage, Eldritch Archer, or Spellsword, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>
            <h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
            <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
            <h4>Extra Attack</h4>
            <p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
            <h4>Eldritch Might</h4>
            <p>Beginning at 6th level, you can add half your Intelligence modifier (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability check you make.</p>
            <h4>Elemental Infusion</h4>
            <p>Starting at 10th level, when you expend a spell slot for your arcane infusion feature you can choose acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, or thunder. Your arcane infusion damage is the type you chose.</p>
            <h4>Magic Ward</h4>
            <p>Beginning at 14th level, the magic of your bond projects a constant ward against magic. Whenever you suffer damage from a spell or other magical effect and you are wielding your bonded weapon, you can reduce the damage by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier.</p>
            <h4>Empowered Spell Strike</h4>
            <p>Beginning at 18th level, when you roll dice for the spell you used for your Spell Strike, you can reroll a number of the dice up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.</p>
            <h4>Archblade</h4>
            <p>At 20th level, the bond with your weapon becomes even stronger. Your bonded weapon gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. Additionally, while wielding your bonded weapon you gain a +1 bonus to your spell attack modifier and your spell save DC increases by 1.</p>

Until the end of your next turn, you can sense any magic items within 60 feet of you that are not behind total cover. You can sense the presence of a magic item hidden on a person, such as in a pocket or tucked into a boot, so long as the person is not behind total cover. You cannot sense an item contained in an extradimensional space, such as in a bag of holding. You also cannot sense an object protected from divination magic, such as through the spell nondetection, or one affected by a spell such as Nystul's magic aura which hides its magical nature. A thin sheet of lead also blocks your magic sense.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you use this feature, you can select one of the magic items you sense and learn its rarity (common, uncommon, rare, very rare, legendary, or artifact) and its magic item category (whether it is armor, a potion, a ring, a rod, a scroll,a staff, a wand, a weapon, or a wondrous item). Your magic sense has no effect on objects which bear magic but are not magic items.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

            <p>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
            <h5>Archery</h5>
            <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
            <h5>Defense</h5>
            <p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
            <h5>Dueling</h5>
            <p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
            <h5>Great Weapon Fighting</h5>
            <p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the twohanded or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>
            <h5>Protection</h5>
            <p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p>

            <p>Your time spent learning the intricacies of magic allows you to create greater effects beyond the form of your weapon, giving you the ability to cast spells at 2nd level.</p>
            <h5>Spell Slots</h5>
            <p>The Swordmage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <h5>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>
            <p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the swordmage spell list (which appears at the end of this document).</p>
            <p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Swordmage table shows when you learn more swordmage spells of your choice from this feature. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots on the Swordmage table.</p>

The new spell must also be of a level for which you have spell slots on the Swordmage table.</p>
            <h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>
            <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your swordmage spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever a swordmage spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a swordmage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
            <p class="indent">

            <p>Beginning at 2nd level, you gain the ability to infuse your bonded weapon with arcane energy. As a bonus action, while holding your bonded weapon you can expend one spell slot,infusing your weapon for ten minutes. While infused, your weapon deals additional force damage. The extra damage is equal to 1 + the level of the spell slot you expended, to a maximum of 4. If your weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.</p>

Choose a spell you know of 1st level or higher with a casting time of one action, and spend a spell slot as if you were casting it as normal. The spell must be capable of targeting a hostile creature or have an area of effect in the shape of a cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere.</p>
            <p class="indent">As part of the action, you then make a single weapon attack with your bonded weapon.

If the spell has an area of effect, it instead only affects the target. Whether the weapon attack hits or misses, the spell slot is expended and the magic fades from your weapon.</p>

            <p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Spellsword Spells table. The spell counts as a swordmage spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of swordmage spells you know.</p>

            <p>When you choose this discipline at 3rd level, you gain the ability to teleport short distances and take advantage of openings your opponents make. When a creature within 30 feet of you hits an ally with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to teleport and appear in an unoccupied space within five feet of the attacking creature. As part of the reaction, you can make a single melee weapon attack against the creature. The triggering creature must be beyond your reach when it hits your ally for you to be able to use this feature.</p>
