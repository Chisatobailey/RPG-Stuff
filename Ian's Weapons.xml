		<description>
			<p>Mack and Stabitha were ordinary shortswords that were functionally and visually identical to one another. Following Agorzach's battle with the Lianne Deathbringer construct however, both bades came in simultaneous contact with a powerful magical artifact. This Artifact (which looked like the handle of a sword) broke and imbued both weapons with power. Agorzach was gifted the knowledge (presumably from the artifact) that the blades could now permanently take into themselves new attributes for causing damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Agorzach chose to coat the blade in the weak giant scorpion venom he collected outside Owl Cry Village. As he was doing this, he lay Stabitha down and its blade came in contact with the smoke and dust that was all that remained of the Shadow Knight the group had just defeated.</p>
			<p class="indent">Mack looks like and ordinary short sword, except it has a slight green sheen to the metal when the light catches it in just the right way.</p>
			<p class="indent">Forged by Poison: Mack is now a permanently poisoned blade. Whenever you hit with Mack the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC= 8 + half your character level) or take 11 (2d10) poison damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>
			<p class="indent">Enhancement: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">The longer you use this weapon, the more secrets you will unlock. Mack gains power when you reach level 8 and becomes the +2 version of itself.</p>

			<p>Mack and Stabitha were ordinary shortswords that were functionally and visually identical to one another. Following Agorzach's battle with the Lianne Deathbringer construct however, both bades came in simultaneous contact with a powerful magical artifact. This Artifact (which looked like the handle of a sword) broke and imbued both weapons with power. Agorzach was gifted the knowledge (presumably from the artifact) that the blades could now permanently take into themselves new attributes for causing damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Agorzach chose to coat the blade in the weak giant scorpion venom he collected outside Owl Cry Village. As he was doing this, he lay Stabitha down and its blade came in contact with the smoke and dust that was all that remained of the Shadow Knight the group had just defeated.</p>
			<p class="indent">Stabitha looks like an ordinary short sword, except it has a slight violet sheen to the metal when the light catches it in just the right way.</p>
			<p class="indent">Forged by Death: Stabitha now causes any wound it inflicts to begin to fester. Whenever you hit with Stabitha the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC= 8 + half your character level) or take 11 (2d10) necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>
			<p class="indent">Enhancement: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">The longer you use this weapon, the more secrets you will unlock. Stabitha gains power when you reach level 8 and becomes the +2 version of itself.</p>

			<p>The Treant Ranger Longbough, by the end of his 124th year had grown disgusted with man-made weapons of iron. So when he began his adventuring carreer. Longbough made sinple weapons of natural deadfall and stone. These in time needed replaced and all he could find were weapons made of steel. H used them, but vowed to himself to find something better.</p>
			<p class="indent">After the fight with Lianne Deathbringer's construct, Longbough realized that magic could be used to create something from very little. This was an idea that had never occurred to him. He had already identified many of the components that would be required to create weapons to strengthen his oun powers but needed to find new material for the bases of his tools.</p>
			<p class="indent">Finally he had the idea to simply grow the weapons himself! First he made a combat trident he named Quencher, then he created a machete he named Pathfinder. Longbough used his magic to form both weapons from his own heartwood and fire tempered them in magical flame (despite his phobia of fire) before completing the rite to empower them.</p>
			<p class="indent">Quench Flame: You place the tip of Quencher in the fire and water bursts forth extinguishing it. Once per long rest, you may use an action to put out any fire (including magic fire) which occupies a square-shapped area that is 20 ft on a side (or less). </p>
			<p class="indent">Burn no More: You gain resistance to fire damage. If you were already vulnerable to fire, then these conditions cancel each other out.</p>

Any creatures within that arc must make a dexterity saving throw at a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your strength modifier or take damage equal to you strength modifier and be knocked prone.</p>
			<p class="indent">Find the Way: You learn the spell Dowsing and may use it 1/short rest for free. When you do so you roll with advantage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Fell: This weapon is now Vorpal. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.</p>
