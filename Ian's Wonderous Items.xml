	<element name="Gem of Therizdun" type="Magic Item" source="Ian's Additions" id="ID_IANSADDITIONS_IANSWONDEROUSITEMS_MAGIC_ITEM_GEM_OF_THERIZDUN">
		<description>
			<p>This is a Citrine gem as large as a nectarine held in plain matrix rock and set as a necklace on an iron chain.</p>
            <p>When wielded by one with the spellcasting ability, the gem is capable of modifying the memories and thoughts of virtually any target. Additionally, it allows the caster to find their target anywhere (as long as the spell remains active).  </p>
			<p>The user takes an attack action and spends one charge to attempt to modify a memory. The caster must be touching the target. A spent charge is lost even if the target resists. The gem can hold up to 3 charges at a time. The target must succeed on a wisdom save against your spell save DC + 3 or be subject to whatever memory or thought modifications the caster desires for the spell's duration or until the spell is broken by another. The table below shows the duration of the gem's effects.</p>
			<p>Once a target has been affected by the stone's power, they can be easily located by the caster of thier spell for as long as the spell is active, even if the caster no longer wields the gem.</p>
			<p>The gem can be recharged at any time by spending spell slots of 3rd level or higher. One slot per charge. Duration of the gem's effects is determined by the level of the slot used to charge it. </p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr><td>Spell Slot Level</td><td>Max duration of effect</td></tr>

		<description>
			<p>This ceramic jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty. Sloshing sounds can be heard from within the jug when it is shaken, even if the jug is empty.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use an action and "spend" a single portion of any liquid placing it inside the Jug and replacing the cork. After one minute, you can uncork the jug as an action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute until the maximum for that liquid has been reached. The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you placed within it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent">Below is a chart for reference. The final decision regarding the maximum amount of a given liquid is made by the DM.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This poorly named figurine is nonetheless beautifully carved in the shape of a giant spider. As an action, the wielder of the "insect" stone may grant themselves or another the ability to envenomate enemies when striking them for 1 minute. The condition lasts until a constitution save of DC 15 ends it.</p>
			<p>On each successful hit, the envenomated enemy suffers 1d6 poison damage. The effect of this venom is cumulative however. Therefore the first hit deals 1d6 poison and each successive hit deals and additional 1d6 until the target dies or the condition ends. </p>
			<p>The stone may be used only once per day and it recharges at dawn.</p>
