			<p>The Bear Folk of the Fornhill Mountain have given birth to many strong Druidic Shamans. They use totems contained in Medicine Bags (usually worn around thier necks) to aid in focusing their magics.</p>
			<p class="indent">Every young mage of the Bear Folk constructs their first Totem and bag when they come of age, but as they grow in power and knowledge they are inspired by Magnar the Great Bear to enhance, strengthen, and even sometimes completely change their totems to better reflect their powers.</p>
