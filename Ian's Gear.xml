			<p>The Bear Folk of the Fornhill Mountain have given birth to many strong Druidic Shamans. They use totems contained in Medicine Bags (usually worn around thier necks) to aid in focusing their magics.</p>
			<p class="indent">Every young mage of the Bear Folk constructs their first Totem and bag when they come of age, but as they grow in power and knowledge they are inspired by Magnar the Great Bear to enhance, strengthen, and even sometimes completely change their totems to better reflect their powers.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At the age of 17, Annael na Mathan Dhaoine of the Bear Folk of the Fornhill Mountains became accepted by her God and was named amoung the Folk. At this time she collected the shed fur of a bear that lived near the place where she was raised by her mother and constructed her first Shamanic Totem and strung it about her neck in the Medicine Bag made by her mother. It has been a little more than a year since that time, and Annael has grown much in both power and knowledge. In the Aftermath of the battle with the construct of Lianne Deathbringer, Annael meditated on the events that had led her to that point and was struck by inspiration from Magnar Himself to remake and evolve her simple totem into an Item of Power. Hidden at the bottom of Lianne's treasure hoard, Annael found a bear's tooth contained in a ring of five bear claws all coated and held together by high-grade silver.</p>
			<p class="indent">Annael took the strange piece of bear-related art and combined it with several small gems she found in the hoard and a few stones she had picked up in her travels by melting down 10 GP from her own pocket to coat the new items and act as a rough "glue". The result was a new Totem to place in her bag weighing about 1 lb.</p>
